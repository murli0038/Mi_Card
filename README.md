# Mi Card

Mi Card is an individualized business card that enables you to share your contact information or business details with someone even if you don't have a physical card on hand. With this app, you can ask others to download and access your business card.

# What I have used in this Mi card

- Containers to lay out your UI
- Columns and Rows to position your UI elements
- Custom fonts
- Material icons
- Style Text widgets
